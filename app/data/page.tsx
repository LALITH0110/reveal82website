            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Property Age Correlation:</strong> Homes built before 1986 have a significantly higher
                  likelihood of having lead service lines, with the highest risk in homes built between 1900-1950.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Geographic Patterns:</strong> Our spatial analysis revealed clusters of high lead levels in
                  specific neighborhoods, particularly in areas with older housing stock and a history of disinvestment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Predictive Factors:</strong> The most significant predictors for lead service lines includes ...
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Environmental Justice:</strong> Our analysis found that low-income communities and communities
                  of color are disproportionately affected by lead service lines, highlighting environmental justice
                  concerns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Model Performance:</strong> Our ensemble machine learning approach achieved high 80s percent accuracy in
                  predicting service line composition, significantly better than random guessing (which would be 50%).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prioritize Replacement:</strong> The city should prioritize service line replacement in
                  neighborhoods with the highest predicted lead levels and greatest health risks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Expand Testing:</strong> Increase water testing coverage, particularly in areas with limited
                  data, to improve model accuracy and identify high-risk properties.

              <h2>Methodology</h2>
              <p>
                Our project employed a comprehensive approach combining statistical analysis and machine learning to
                address two key problems:
              </p>

              <h3>1. Predicting Lead Contamination</h3>
              <p>To predict the percentage of households with lead contamination above 10ppb, we used:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spatial Logistic Regression:</strong> We developed spatial logistic regression models to
                  analyze how lead contamination is distributed across Chicago, accounting for geographic clustering and
                  neighborhood effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spatial Linear Regression:</strong> This helped us model relationships between household lead
                  levels and geographic or structural factors such as neighborhood, property characteristics, and
                  historical trends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>PCA Regression:</strong> We used Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality and
                  address multicollinearity among predictors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bootstrapping Methods:</strong> To address potential sampling bias in our dataset, we employed
                  bootstrapping techniques to ensure all neighborhoods, wards, and demographic groups were adequately
                  represented.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>2. Identifying Lead Service Lines</h3>
              <p>For classifying service lines as lead or non-lead, we implemented:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> We tested multiple algorithms including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>XGBoost</li>
                    <li>k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)</li>
                    <li>Random Forest Classifiers</li>
                    <li>Fully Connected Neural Networks</li>
                    <li>Naïve Bayes Classifiers</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ensemble Methods:</strong> We combined multiple models using ensemble techniques to improve
                  prediction accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> We created new features from existing data, including property
                  age categories, neighborhood risk scores, and distance-based metrics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-Validation:</strong> We used cross-validation to ensure model reliability and
                  prevent overfitting.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
              <p>We evaluated our models using:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Confusion Matrices:</strong> To visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and
                  false negatives.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Addressing Bias</h3>
              <p>We took several steps to address potential biases in our analysis:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ethical Review:</strong> We conducted an ethical review of our methodology and results to
                  identify and address potential biases.
                </li>
              </ul>

          <TabsContent value="data-sources" className="space-y-6 pt-4">
            <div className="prose max-w-none">
              <h2>Data Sources</h2>
              <p>
                Our analysis integrated multiple data sources to create a comprehensive dataset for predicting lead
                service lines and contamination levels:

                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Data Limitations</h3>
              <p>We acknowledge several limitations in our data:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sampling Bias:</strong> The water testing data may not be representative of all Chicago
                  households, as testing is often voluntary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Missing Data:</strong> Many service lines are classified as "suspected lead" without
                  definitive confirmation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Temporal Limitations:</strong> Water testing data represents a snapshot in time and may not
                  capture variations due to seasonal changes or water system modifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Limited Historical Data:</strong> Incomplete records for older properties and service line
                  installations.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Despite these limitations, our integrated dataset provides a robust foundation for analyzing lead
                service lines and contamination risks in Chicago.
